This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## API usage

Backend models and endpoints are generated using nestJS/swagger and available on the frontend out of the box. To sync recent changes on dev please run `npm run swagger` to get lastest changes if an update to the backend was being made.

## Considerations

This repository uses react server components to fetch data and was simplified for dev purposes.
